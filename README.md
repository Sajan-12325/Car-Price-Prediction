# Car-Price-Prediction

Overview

This project aims to predict car prices based on various features.

Tasks Completed Today

The dataset was loaded using pandas, and initial data exploration steps were conducted to check for missing values and data types. Commands such as df.info(), df.isnull().sum(), and df.dtypes were used to understand the dataset structure. The first few records were displayed using df.head() to get an overview of the data.

For data visualization, a bar plot was created to analyze the average car price by brand using seaborn.barplot(). To improve readability, it was suggested to sort brands by price and use a better color palette. Also used heatmap to find correlation.



Next Steps

Implement feature engineering, feature selection techniques.

Train regression models for price prediction.

Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
